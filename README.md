# MyLibraryApp

The MyLibraryApp (name subject to change) is a simple book tracking app. As of right now, the app is just a C file containing the logic for creating and  modifying the library.

Eventually, I hope to turn this into an actual desktop app using Electron & NodeJS or some other framework.
